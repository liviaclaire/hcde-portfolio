      <h1>Livia Brown Portfolio</h1>
      <p>My name is Livia, which you probably didn't know in Hebrew means, 'lioness.' What my name doesn't tell you is that I've had experience using social to meet organizational goals. That my passion has shifted
      from marketing to human-centered design after working mental health based community space for prenatal and postpartum families.
      It was there that I witnessed how lack of design could strongly help or hinder common experiences. I'm a 1st year HCDE MS student currently working at Girl Scouts of Western Washington aiding with design and marketing efforts. 
      I'm a California native adjusting to this weather, but loving all the hiking the PNW has to offer. </p>
