      <h1>Livia Brown Portfolio</h1>

      <p>My name is Livia, which you probably didn't know in Hebrew means, 'lioness.'</p>

<p>What my name doesn't tell you is that I've had experience using social to meet organizational goals. That my passion has shifted
from marketing to human-centered design after working mental health based community space for prenatal and postpartum families.
It was there that I witnessed how lack of design could strongly help or hinder common experiences. </p>

<p>I'm a 1st year HCDE MS student currently working at Girl Scouts of Western Washington aiding with design and marketing efforts. 
I'm a California native adjusting to this weather, but loving all the hiking the PNW has to offer. </p>
